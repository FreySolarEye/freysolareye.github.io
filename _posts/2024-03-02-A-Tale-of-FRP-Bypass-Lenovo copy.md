This blog elucidates an issue encountered during the initialization of a newly acquired Lenovo device, obtained through a contact in the Netherlands (thanks Alex), featuring Factory Reset Protection (FRP). My interest was piqued by the challenge posed in activating the device. The commencement of this investigative process involved an in-depth exploration of FRP, its inherent functionalities, and its potential to enforce a stringent lockdown on the device in instances of theft or to restrict access, even following a complete restoration to factory settings.

# What is FRP

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature implemented in mobile devices, primarily smartphones and tablets, to enhance the protection of personal data and prevent unauthorized access in case the device is lost, stolen, or reset to its factory settings. FRP is commonly associated with Android devices.

When FRP is enabled, it requires the user to enter the Google account credentials (username and password) that were previously associated with the device. This authentication is necessary after performing a factory reset or when setting up the device for the first time. The aim is to ensure that only the device owner, or someone with the authorized Google account information, can access and use the device.

FRP functions as a deterrent against theft and unauthorized use by discouraging potential intruders from resetting the device to gain access to it. It adds an additional layer of security beyond traditional screen lock methods. This feature is particularly useful in protecting sensitive information and maintaining the privacy of the device owner.

# Requirements

  * Lenovo Tablet series (TB-X-MODEL)
  * Software Version TB-X505L-RF01_190519 or prior  




# Proof Of Concept
{:.no_toc}


A brief explanation of the bypass mechanism and its operational process is as follows: Upon the initial boot-up of the phone, when encountering Factory Reset Protection (FRP), the Lenovo End User License Agreement (EULA) is presented, necessitating user acceptance. However, an exploitable vulnerability arises when a user highlights and attempts to share the EULA text via Short Message Service (SMS). Utilizing the SMS option, a user can create a group, subsequently entering a random contact number for SMS transmission.

Within the SMS input, an individual can hover over to the Location feature. Clicking the location button triggers a request for permission activation. Upon consenting to the permission prompt, the user is redirected to the Location Application settings. Here, one can search for other applications, specifically targeting the "settings" keyword. This search yields the Settings Application button, enabling unrestricted access to the phone's settings and bypassing integrity controls.

Proceeding to the Applications and Notifications section, the user can disable both "Android Setup" and "Google Play Services" while also clearing the cache. Following these steps, the user returns to the Setup menu, continues with the process, and identifies the point where the message "Your device is getting ready" is displayed. Swiftly transitioning back to the Wi-Fi options, the user locates the Offline "Set Up Offline" option.

Before clicking the Offline Setup, a revisit to the Lenovo EULA is required. Within the SMS of the previously created group, a prompt emerges, indicating that Google Play Services must be enabled for use. Following this directive, the user re-engages with the EULA menu, proceeds with the installation, and intercepts the "Your Device is getting ready" message. A double-tap facilitates a return to the Wi-Fi option, allowing the user to execute the "Set Up Offline" process. This method successfully circumvents FRP, as Google Services were enabled, and the setup transitioned seamlessly through the offline installation, eliminating the association with the previous email owner who had synchronized the device, thus bypassing the FRP completely. 


# The outcome

The outcome was complete unrestricted access to the device itself; Thus, bypassing the FRP and unlocking it completely.

# Patching Notes
{:.no_toc}

As per Lenovo PSIRT, they have determined that it was an Android feature that allowed users to copy and share EULA text. Back in 2021, Android realized this could lead to security issues, and provided OEMs with an API to disable the feature. Currently supported Lenovo tablets (those launched after 2021) do not allow users to copy and share text at the EULA screen and are therefore not vulnerable. The device of "Lenovo TB-X505L" was EOL when the fix from Android was released, and therefore it was not patched.


# Timeline of disclosure to vendor
{:.no_toc}

<b>04/01/2024</b>: The vendor was formally contacted, presenting a comprehensive Proof of Concept (PoC) alongside a demonstration video elucidating the FRP Bypass.

<b>05/01/2024</b>: Additional intricacies pertaining to the attack surface were furnished to the vendor, encompassing specific details such as the Android version and software version for a more thorough understanding.

<b>05/01/2024</b>: Subsequent to the provision of information, the vendor was contacted again and duly acknowledged the identified vulnerability. They proceeded to initiate communication with the development team at Lenovo.

<b>17/01/2024</b>: A follow-up communication was established with the vendor seeking an update concerning the FRP (Factory Reset Protection).

<b>17/01/2024</b>: The vendor responded, stipulating that the issue has been registered and is being tracked under the identifier LEN-150690.

<b>03/02/2024</b>: In response to a subsequent inquiry, the vendor communicated the current status of the vulnerability. Furthermore, it was conveyed that the software version in question has reached its End of Life (EOL) and consequently, no longer supports updates. The vendor explicated that tablets presently under active support do not permit the sharing of text before the End User License Agreement (EULA) is accepted, effectively mitigating the potential attack surface for FRP bypass on these devices.

<b>09/02/2024</b>: The vendor was contacted to give permissions for a public blog post, waiting  for approval.

<b>23/02/2024</b>: Lenovo PSIRT gave the permission for publication, by including some extra information about the patching process.
